Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

A variable can be used before it has been declared.
By using let and const keywords the block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
